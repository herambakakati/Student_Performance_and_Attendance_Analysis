# Student Performance and Attendance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes student performance and attendance data using Python.  
The objective is to understand how attendance and assessment scores impact overall student performance and to provide meaningful insights through data analysis and visualization.

---

## Objectives
- Clean and prepare student performance and attendance data
- Calculate attendance percentages
- Compute weighted performance scores
- Classify students based on performance levels
- Identify low attendance cases and top performers
- Visualize insights for academic decision-making

---

## Dataset
The project uses an Excel dataset containing:
- Student names
- Attendance records
- Scores from:
  - Mini Test 1
  - Mini Test 2
  - Live Test
  - Assignment

---

## Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Attendance percentage calculation
- Weighted percentage calculation:
  - Attendance: 40%
  - Mini Test 1: 10%
  - Mini Test 2: 10%
  - Live Test: 20%
  - Assignment: 20%
- Performance classification:
  - Excellent (≥ 85%)
  - Good (71–84%)
  - Average (50–70%)
  - Needs Improvement (< 50%)
- Identification of:
  - Students with low attendance
  - Top-performing students
- Data visualization using charts and plots

---

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Excel

---

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   `student_performance_analysis.ipynb`
3. Ensure the Excel file is in the same directory
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially

---

## Key Insights
- Attendance has a strong influence on overall performance
- Students with consistent attendance tend to score higher
- A small group of students significantly outperforms the class average
